- Accent color: Use vibrant retro colors like #DC143C (Crimson) for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements to mimic the glow of classic arcade games.
- Use the 'Press Start 2P' pixel-style font for headings and key text elements to evoke a retro gaming feel.
- Simple, geometric icons that reflect the digital and cosmic theme.
